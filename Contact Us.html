                  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</h2>
                    <p><font-size="2"><br><br>What Is Extreme Ironing?
                    <br>•As the name implies, extreme ironing involves ironing clothing outdoors in a bizarre, remote, or unusual location.
      The Extreme Ironing Bureau states that the sport “combines the thrill of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt.<br>
                    <br>Is Extreme Ironing Real?
                    <br>•While EI is a real activity with enthusiastic participants, there is some debate about whether it can truly be classified as a sport.
    Many sources suggest that EI athletes and fans consider it a good-natured joke or a performance rather than a true sport.
    The EIB’s official Facebook page seems to function as an online community for hobbyists and fans rather than a traditional regulatory organization like most sports have.</p>
                    <br> Is There A Official EI Competition?
                    <br>•There was an official competition that occurred in Germany in 2002: the 1st Extreme Ironing World Championships.
      A British group won the team event, and a German with the moniker “Hot Pants” won the individual competition.
      There is no information about a follow-up event.
